## Project Marking Guide

(In progress... I'm adding to this throughout the term)

The final projects will be marked out of 100 points (later translated to % for grads/undergrads)

The approximate breakdown is as follows (however, it may vary depending on the style of the project): 
   * Project/Bot concept/idea and its development throughout the term:  40 points
   * Writing/presentation of the final report (should cover: introduction, related work, project motivation, evaluation metholodogy, what you learned, impact of what you learned, limitations of your findings/results, future work): 20 points
   * Linkages to related work (course or workshop readings, as well as other background works): 20 points
   * Evaluation (appropriateness of methodology, how it was executed, were limitations or alternatives considered): 20 points
   
   
As mentioned in class at the beginning of term, the following criteria will be used when I provide marks: 
   * Quality of the project/bot – idea, motivation, conceptualization, evaluation, future work revealed, potential impact to researchers, society etc.
   * Quality of the written reports, presentation
   * Does the presentation of the project demonstrate  “deep” knowledge of the concepts taught in the course (and in the readings/workshops), were you able to go beyond the core course content and find other relevant works/papers
   * You can expect grades according to the following:
      * A+:  Should be publishable in a workshop (or shows potential for).   
      * A or A-:  Project is at an excellent or very good level (all components are well treated)
      * B+ or B:  Meets expectations in terms of all components. 
      * B- or C:  Below expectations ine one or more ways
   * Note that individual students will be awarded grades that are prorated according to the effort they put into their project.  Some student grades may be lower or higher than the overall team grade.
  
   
Final class presentations: 
   * Present the entire "story" of your project, what you did in terms of bot design, why you worked on this bot (i.e., why it matters), how you evaluated the bot, which evaluation approach you used (methodology) and why, lessons learned, issues you faced, what kind of future work could be done next. 
   * You will have (TBD) minutes for your presentation.  Please test out your laptops in advance. 
   * We will have discussion for each project, after each presentation and on Slack.  Please listen attentively and contribute!
      
      
Some hints for the final report:
   * Do take into the consideration the feedback I (and your TA) give you following the proposal and interim reports.   If you have questions, ask sooner rather than later.  If you disagree with my sugestions, that's ok (and in some cases encouraged!), just explain why you decided to do something else. 
   * The way the report is written is worth a certain percentage as mentioned above, BUT the writing can also impact other elements if they are not presented well.  Iterate on the report and make sure all members contribute to the writing and confirm it is coherent. 
   * Make sure each student clearly indicates their contributions to the projects (I'm not interested in hearing I did a commit to the project, you need to describe what you did).
